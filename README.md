Project Overview:
The NYT Vehicle Dealers site is an easy-to-navigate platform that allows users to explore cars available for purchase. Displaying vehicles, presenting financing options, and delivering essential company details. It includes a home page that presents the dealership, a products page with comprehensive listings of cars for sale (featuring images, prices, mileage, and locations), and a finance page describing safe payment methods. The about us section emphasizes the company's mission, vision, and background, whereas the contact section offers branch information, embedded Google Maps for locations, and a query form. A uniform header, navigation bar, and footer featuring social media links bring cohesion to the site, while the contemporary stylesheet guarantees responsive design, tidy layouts, and elegant styling on every device
